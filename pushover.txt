By registering Pushover devices, you can receive notifications when someone sends you a song.

How to register a pushover device:

1. Download Pushover in the App or Play Store.
2. Log in using the email 'mangonotification@gmail.com' and the password 'TaylorSwift13'.
3. Give your device a name. It can be anything, but it should contain your Mango name.
4. Ask me to register your device name. It's not yet possible for you to register your device by yourself.

You can enter multiple devices.
